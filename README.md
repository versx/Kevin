# Kevin (Jarvis++) _aka Jarvis 2.0 aka UIC 2.0_  

This repository is for educational purposes only, any liability to the project owner is dismissed, kick rocks Niantic!  

Works with [DeviceConfigManager](https://github.com/versx/DeviceConfigManager)  

Build scripts are hardcoded, change paths to suite needs. No support is provided or given.  

**Important:** You will still need to provide a MITM static library (or dynamic...) that supports dynamic library injection for this to work, this is not a full deployment solution.
